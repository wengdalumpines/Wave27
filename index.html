        <p>To edit the MX Records you must supply at least two mail server addresses. The addresses must be domains or subdomains and cannot be IP addresses. If you are only able to access your mail server via its IP address, you must enter an IP address for your domain's MX Record instead.</p>
        <p>Please note:
Changing your MX Records will change the servers which route your incoming mail. It is suggested not to alter MX Records unless you are sure of the changes as this can potentially cause mail delivery problems.</p>
